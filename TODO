- When the description is too long, truncate it.
- Improve the find_list_argument function not to use it for hacks like 'console_scripts': []
   - And actually implement something to handle 'console_scripts'.
- List packages in %files according to names, not only %{pypi_name} - will probably be more
   complex due to usage of find_packages(), but should be doable.
   ? Maybe it would suffice to use distribute internals for that?
- Test template rendering.
? Add Group tag - not completely necessary, not sure how to get it
   ? from trove classifiers - but they may yield more Groups
   ? or just put Development/Libraries in the template
? Try running tests - probably not possible in general case? "python setup.py nosetests" is
   generally not enough (for this package for example)
x Handle package data files, if given ("--install-data" switch for "setup.py --install" in
   some cases) - some data can't be separated (like pyp2rpm templates), some can =>
   probably generally undecidable.


- = definitelly TODO
? = not clear how to achieve/not sure if needed
x = not achievable ATM, accepting ideas :)
